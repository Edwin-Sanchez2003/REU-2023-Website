            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              Ransomware attacks have grown significantly in the past dozen
              years and have disrupted businesses that engage with personal data.
              In this paper, we discuss the identification of ransomware, malware,
              and benign software from one another using machine learning tech-
              niques. We collected data samples from repositories on the internet
              as well as using a dataset from a previous study that provided a
              basis for our approach. We also collected ransomware, malware,
              and benign software samples manually from Cuckoo Sandbox™.
              We also filtered on certain feature groups to test to see if certain
              activity/processes in the infection process could be used to correctly
              distinguish ransomware from malware and benign software. These
              feature groups represent correlated processes within a running ap-
              plication: network activity, PROC memory activity, registry/events
              processes, and file interactions. The datasets were analyzed using
              several ML models which included Random Forest, SVM, Gradi-
              ent Boosting, and Decision Trees using binary classification. The
              best classifiers for distinctly identifying ransomware from benign
              software were Random Forest and SVC with an F1- score of 86%
              and an F1-score of 82% as well as an 85% in overall accuracy for
              Random Forest. In addition to ransomware versus benign software,
              we also compared malware software to ransomware data. Yielding
              a 100% accuracy in performance, Gradient Boosting Classifier and
              Decision Trees were the best at distinguishing ransomware from
              malware software. This high result may partially be caused by a
              smaller malware and ransomware dataset. Overall, we were able
              to successfully distinguish ransomware from malware and benign
              software.<a href="papers/Sorting_Ransomware_and_Malware.pdf"><b>Read More</b></a>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              Point cloud data gathered through millimeter wave sensors has
              garnered increasing attention for its critical applications, including
              automotive radars, security systems, and notably, gesture recog-
              nition. It provides a non-intrusive and robust approach towards
              human-computer interactions; however, its reliance on real-time
              data makes resilience of paramount concern. Attacks on millimeter-
              wave sensors can have catastrophic effects. From real-time spoofing
              to data poisoning attacks or even just imperfect or poor data, sys-
              tems based on 2D and 3D point cloud machine learning models can
              be extremely vulnerable. Despite this, there exist few studies pri-
              oritizing the robustness of time-sensitive point clouds. This study
              presents an in-depth examination on the effects of noisy data on
              frame based time-sensitive point clouds used in millimeter wave
              gesture recognition machine learning models. Noisy data can be
              introduced during the training stage where imperfect data is fed to
              the model, causing this model to misclassify test-time samples and
              lower the overall accuracy of the model. We stage and evaluate the
              impact of four different, simple data noising scenarios to observe
              vulnerabilities within this system and to emphasize the importance
              of robust machine learning models. Noisy databases are particularly
              relevant to deep learning systems because these models need large
              amounts of data to train, many of which commonly scraped from
              the internet with little to no manual inspection. Our findings high-
              light the importance to not only dedicate time and research towards
              innovations in mmWave gesture recognition, but also towards the
              robustness and resiliency of these systems in order to proactively
              prevent destructive effects.

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 mil-
              lion people around the world become victims of a stroke
              every year. Of those 15 million people, 5 million succumb
              to the disease and another 5 million who survive become
              permanently disabled. Though it may not be common for
              those under the age of 40, anyone can become susceptible to
              a stroke, as factors such as high blood pressure can play a
              major role increasing one’s risk. It is crucial to identify such
              symptoms to discover patterns within a patient that may lead
              to a stroke. In this paper, we utilize five different graph clus-
              tering techniques to analyze patient data in order to evaluate
              and find the most effective and accurate method of detect-
              ing a stroke. Patient data from both stroke and non-stroke
              patients are used to identify phenotypes, which then form
              clusters to uncover overlapping patterns in the symptoms.
              Finally, we conclude our discussion with our final thoughts
              to the study and other methods that could be evaluated in
              the future. &nbsp<a href="papers/Enhanced_Disease_Detection_via_Graph_Clustering.pdf"><b>Read More</b></a>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach
              for training machine learning models across individual devices
              while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces many challenges,
              specifically a vulnerability to adversarial attacks due to its strict
              adherence to ensuring individual client model and data privacy.
              To mitigate these issues, dynamic clipping techniques have been
              proposed which dynamically adjust the gradient clipping threshold
              during model aggregation. However current iterations depend on
              specific and often intensive calculations to determine a clipping
              threshold which can lead to an over fitting to a specific data set or
              attacker model. In this paper, we address the limitations of existing
              FL and dynamic clipping approaches by introducing a novel method
              that incorporates a group of trusted users during the aggregation
              of client models for a global update. By identifying and utilizing
              a subset of trusted clients, our method enhances the robustness
              of model aggregation against malicious updates. This approach
              not only maintains the model’s performance but also improves its
              resistance to adversarial influences. We demonstrate the effective-
              ness of our proposed method through extensive experiments thus
              showcasing its superiority and simplicity in achieving enhanced
              model security in federated learning settings.

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
              Biometric Facial Authentication has become a widely
              used mode of authentication in recent years, which can be
              attributed to the ever-growing popularity of mobile devices.
              With this growth in popularity, there is also a growth in
              concern over privacy for biometrics. Along with the issue of
              template revocability with biometric data, there is a need for
              a system that can provide for these issues while remaining
              easy to use and practical. BioCapsule is a system designed
              to solve these issues. While BioCapsule has been tested for
              its face authentication capabilities, this paper extends the
              scheme to Active Authentication, where a user is continu-
              ously authenticated throughout a session on a mobile device.
              The MOBIO dataset is used for testing, which contains video
              recordings of 150 individuals using mobile devices over sev-
              eral sessions. We find that the BioCapsule system not only
              performs comparably to the baseline system performance,
              but in some cases exceeds baseline performance in terms of
              False Acceptance Rate, False Rejection Rate, and Equal Error
              Rate. We examine these findings to learn about both the na-
              ture of the Active Authentication task and how BioCapsule
              interacts with this system. We also examine hyperparameters
              such as time interval for sampling user facial features, and
              window size, referring to how many past samples to average
              over with the current sample to determine user authenticity.<a
